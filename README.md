# FlavorFusion

Welcome to the FlavorFusion repository, a full-stack application designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and the Backend for Frontend (BFF) architecture. This application fetches data from Spoonacular API and also collects and stores data to a database using a pure JavaScript-controlled form. The application allows users to browse hundreds of recipes and apply various filters, such as health score and diet types. 

If you're looking to explore new and exciting flavors, FlavorFusion is the perfect application for you. With its user-friendly interface and robust search functionality, you can easily discover recipes that cater to your unique dietary needs and preferences.

To check out the live version of FlavorFusion, visit <a href="https://flavorfusion.onrender.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FlavorFusion!</a>. We hope you enjoy using this application as much as we enjoyed creating it!
